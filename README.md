- In order to complete our learning experience and to learn further about the Web, Javascript was implemented into the calculators/labs.
- Developed CSS Animations and a clean immersive layout.
- Layered Approach to CSS, HTML, and Javascript as described in Mr. M's tech talk.
- Developed Navbar in HTML to route to all the assembled pages.
- Event Based Programming when clicking buttons to display the results in the calculator and to reroute to .html pages.
